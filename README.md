# Overview

I used React, Firebase, and Visual Studio Code as my IDE. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where the content can change dynamically without requiring a full page reload. Firebase is a platform developed by Google that provides a set of services and tools for building web and mobile applications. It offers a variety of features that help developers with tasks like database management, authentication, hosting, cloud functions, and more.

The purpose of this software was to learn how to integrate cloud services into my apps. I also used the opportunity to learn about React.

# Cloud Database

From Firebase, I'm using Firestore and the Authentication services.Firestore is a NoSQL, document-oriented database provided by Firebase, which is a comprehensive platform for building web and mobile applications. Firestore serves as a backend data store, enabling developers to store, query, and manage data for their applications.

NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are a class of database management systems that differ from traditional relational databases in terms of data model, schema design, and storage mechanisms. NoSQL databases are designed to handle diverse data models and are often used for large-scale, distributed systems. Unlike relational databases, NoSQL databases typically have a flexible or schema-less data model. This means that each record in a database collection (or equivalent) can have a different structure, and there are no rigid requirements for the data schema.

# Development Environment

My IDE was Visual Studio Code. VS Code is a free and open-source code editor developed by Microsoft. It has gained widespread popularity among developers for its lightweight, fast, and extensible nature. VS Code is designed to be a versatile and customizable code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and development scenarios.

I used JavaScript as the language of the application. JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily known for its use in web development to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript allows developers to add behavior to web pages, making them responsive to user interactions. 
And React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications where the content can change dynamically without requiring a full page reload.
